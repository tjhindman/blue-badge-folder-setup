- should .gitignore file and app.js file already be on starter repo? why not otherwise?
- can't copy code text samples in lessons where it says copy code
- "npm init -y" isn't introduced?
- is "router" the only way to have sub routes for your api? why are we using app.use() middleware instead of app.get()?
- "require().import()" logic a bit confusing for first time seeing it
- in pg admin installer lesson... did I follow installation correctly? should the desktop pgAdmin have already been installed?
- first screenshot looks same as screenshot on previous lesson, and summary #4 looks like it has wrong endpoint (https://elevenfifty.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/9-dot-2-4-crafting-a-response?module_item_id=64796)
- need to look more into next() functionality for validateSession functionality in validate-session.js (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.router)
- there isn't .gitignore file setup instructions for "/client" folder setup (https://elevenfifty.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/1-dot-1-client-html-and-css-setup?module_item_id=64832)
- why not "LiveServer" extension for starting client HTML file instead of starting server => client (localhost:8080)
